## Background
Recently, as of November 2019, there has been a movement towards rebuilding the forest. There has been a lot of sites where people around the world can donate their money to help support the organization to plant trees. When I was watching video on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/), I came across a shoutout from [Vat19](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDRbNGFusqlXX4a5vwi9ouQ) sharing about [Team Trees](https://teamtrees.org/). They state they team trees will plant 1 tree for every $1 donated to their website. So I search for more similar movements on the internet and that is when I realized that there has been a lot of similar movements around the world.

## Problems
There are 2 main ways to grow trees. 1st is to plant the seeds. 2nd is to plant the saplings. There existing technological ways to plant seeds in the forest, which is by using a drone to disperse the seeds while flying. However, as of planting Saplings, I fail to find any robot to do this tiring task, especially when one is going to mass planting tree saplings. Even when we are in an era where technology is everywhere, saplings are still planted using manual labor.

### Benefits of Planting Saplings Instead of Seeds
By planting saplings, it will give a significant head start since the mature rate is shorter, which will result in a quicker visual impact. Therefore losing plants is lower to that as saplings.
