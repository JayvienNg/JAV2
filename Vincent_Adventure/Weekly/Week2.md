# Micro Python
I have been learning python for a while now. Micro python is similar to python where the code structure is more or less identical to Python

## Code style
Whenever I write a code, I tend to put sections of my code in functions, with a name related to what the code does. By doing this, I am able to debug my code by searching through the list of functions instead of searching through the entire code. However, writing the code in functions increase the memory storage of the device, which is not efficient in terms of device memory usage. To add on, I am using up too many lines to write the code, which will slow the configuration of the device I use. to improve, I can short the lines by having a better algorithm or squeeze all the lines to one line. I priorities on readability over speed, so the only way I can increase the speed is by creating a better algorithm. 
Due to the fact that I have a short memory, I comment my codes as much as possible. It is a good practice adopt by all coders.
## Space Invader Game!

Now, I will be putting what I have learn about MicroPython and BBC Microbit to a test by replicating a traditional game called
For this game, I will be using [BBC Microbit](https://microbit.org/) hardware, which comes with a built in 5x5 led matrix.
BBC Micro is design for small projects, in other words there many built in actuators like LED and sensors but it have very low memory. for this game, I will design the gam in such that player only have dodge the alien, but doesn't have to shoot them down. I will be using Thonny as my IDE to write and upload code to the BBC Microbit.

This is my Source Code
